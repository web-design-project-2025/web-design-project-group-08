      "The history of desserts is far older than we might think. From honey cakes offered to gods in ancient Egypt to today’s delicate French mousses, desserts have witnessed the evolution of human civilization.",
      "Around 2500 BCE, ancient Egyptians used honey—the earliest known sweetener—in religious offerings. They mixed unleavened bread with dried fruits and honey to create primitive sweet dishes. The Greeks later expanded upon this with \"plakous,\" a layered pastry made with sesame, nuts, and honey.",
      "In the Middle Ages, sugar became a luxury good and began to appear on the tables of European aristocrats. Desserts shifted from sacred rituals to opulent banquets. Sugar sculptures shaped like gardens, palaces, and animals were status symbols for the elite.",
      "The Industrial Revolution changed everything. Sugar became more accessible, and new baking technologies allowed desserts to enter everyday life. By the late 19th century, ice cream and cakes became common in urban households and symbolized celebration.",
      "Today, desserts are not just about taste—they are a blend of culture, art, and emotion. From a cup of bubble tea to a dish of molecular mousse, sweets have traveled through time, carrying both memory and innovation."
